            <!-- The target attribute (of form element) specifies where to display the response that is received after submitting the form. The target attribute can have one of the following values:
            _blank:	The response is displayed in a new window or tab
            _self:	The response is displayed in the current window
            _parent:The response is displayed in the parent frame
            _top:	The response is displayed in the full body of the window
            framename:	The response is displayed in a named iframe
            The default value is _self which means that the response will open in the current window. -->


            <!-- The <label> Element

The <label> element is useful for screen-reader users, because the screen-reader will read out loud the label when the user focuses on the input element.

The <label> element also helps users who have difficulty clicking on very small regions (such as radio buttons or checkboxes) - because when the user clicks the text within the <label> element, it toggles the radio button/checkbox.

The for attribute of the <label> tag should be equal to the id attribute of the <input> element to bind them together. -->


            <!-- The Name Attribute for <input>
Notice that each input field must have a name attribute to be submitted.
If the "name" attribute is omitted, the value of the input field will not be sent at all. -->


            <!-- The <select> element defines a drop-down list 
                The <option> element defines an option that can be selected.
                By default, the first item in the drop-down list is selected.

                To define a pre-selected option, add the "selected/checked" attribute to the option
                    
                Use the "size" attribute to specify the number of visible values:
                    <select name="cofee" id="cofee"  size="5">

                Use the "multiple" attribute to allow the user to select more than one value:
                    <select name="cofee" id="cofee"  size="5" multiple>
            -->
